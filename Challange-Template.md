## What's your streak challenge
I pledge to make a single page application everyday till the best I can. I will also learn new stuff by checking documentations and doing research for my apps.

###Current Streak:
Streak counter: (your streak in number)
Starting date: (starting date)
Last commit date: (last commit date)

## My project's list:
* [App name3](Git repo link for app) --> [AppName3 Live Demo](app codepen link) 
* [App name2](Git repo link for app) --> [AppName2 Live Demo](app codepen link) 
* [App name1](Git repo link for app) --> [AppName1 Live Demo](app codepen link) 

##Note:
1. Your latest app goes on top in My project's list.
2. If you have breaked your streak, you have to only change the current streak section and add the new apps link on top of previous project list.
3. No matter how many times you have loosen your daily streak, doesn't matter. What's matter is you try again to beat your previous streak number and see the piling up of the your project list.
4. You can make this page your readme.md in your repo.
5. You can customize your readme.md page by adding other stuff too but don't forget to maintain the above sections.
6. After reading the notes propery, you can delete the notes section in your repo front page.
