## What's your streak challenge
I pledge to make a single page application every day till the best I can. I will also learn new stuff by checking the documentation and doing research for my apps.

### Current Streak:
Streak counter: (your streak in number)
Starting date: (starting date)
Last commit date: (last commit date)

## My project's list:
* [App name3](Git repo link for app) --> [AppName3 Live Demo](app codepen link) 
* [App name2](Git repo link for app) --> [AppName2 Live Demo](app codepen link) 
* [App name1](Git repo link for app) --> [AppName1 Live Demo](app codepen link) 

## Note:
1. Your latest app goes on top of My project's list.
2. If you have broken your streak, you have to only change the current streak section and add the new apps link on top of the previous project list.
3. No matter how many times you have loosened your daily streak, doesn't matter. What's matter is you try again to beat your previous streak number and see the tons of apps in your project list.
4. You can make this page as your readme.md in your repo.
5. You can customize your readme.md by adding other stuff too but don't forget to maintain the above sections.
6. After reading the notes properly, you can delete the notes section in your repo front page.
